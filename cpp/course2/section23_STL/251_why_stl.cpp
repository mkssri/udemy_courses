/*

size of data: for application: so big.
to store collection of values: we need datastructure.
datastructure: collection/arrangement of data for its efficient
utilization. so depending on your utilization you can arrange
the data, so you can use it efficiently. 

efficiency in terms of TIME and SPACE.

we want data to be stored and retrieved easily
and occupy less space.

so when you have collection of data where do you
store ?? in datastructure :)

datastructures available in CPP

/* 10 student marks */
/* A: [0,1,2,3,...7,8,9] */

/* built in DS: array: collection of similar type of elements */
/* int A[10]; --> this array will be created inside a STACK 
 * int* A = new int[10] --> this array will be created inside a HEAP
 *
 * arrays are available in cpp, but problem is their size is fixed
 * you need to initially only let us know the size of array
 *
 * solve: create larger array and copy the values
