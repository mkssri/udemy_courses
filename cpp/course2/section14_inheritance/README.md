- Inheritance:
  acquiring the features of existing design in to the new design, so that way we can re use
  and dont need to redo everything from scratch.

  class Rectangle
  {
   int length
   int breadth
  }

  // inherit from rectangle
  class Cuboid : Rectangle
  {

  }

  In this way we can achieve re-usability of the code.

- This is concept of inheritance: that means it is a procedure for borrowing existing features of a class
  in to the new class.
