/*
 * There are 3 types of errors that are possible
 * syntax error : compiler detects the error
 * logical error : debugger helps to detect the error
 * runtime error : bad input, problem with resources, (user problems)
 *                 so, user is responsible for the run time errors.
 * during runtime error program abruptly stops and that is why it is
 * called runtime error
 *
 * These runtime errors are called as "EXCEPTIONS"
 * Exception is nothing but a situation in which we get a runtime error
 *
 * giving a proper message to user and informing him about the problem 
 * and also providing guidance to solve the problem.
