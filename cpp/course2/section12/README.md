# 156. Introduction to OOPS
1. modular programming: it will have functions and data
2. object oriented programming: it will have different objects, which consists of functions and data

# 157. Priniciples of object-orientation
1. Abstraction
      - we do not need to know all the details of how functions are implemented
      - just knowing function names is sufficient


2. Encapsulation
      - data hiding
      - avoid misshandling
          - private: data, public: functions
          - similar to in how television, buttons are coming out (functions)
          - data is inside which is private.


3. Inheritance

inherit/borrow all features from parent.

4. Polymorphism

# 158. Class vs Objects

- class : it is a definition.
- obhect: it is an instance.
